                I am passionate about the areas of technology and art, my purpose is to
                unite them focusing on the fullstack development career. Area in which I study
                intensively, looking for challenges and projects to improve my technical
                knowledge and amplify my self-learning capacity.<br/>
                <br/>   
                &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
                I worked for 7 years as an art teacher, a position in which I developed good
                communication to exchange information and the ability to act under pressure. At
                the same time, since 2011 I have been creating illustrations and drawings in
                traditional and digital media as a freelance designer and illustrator.<br/>
                <br/>   
                &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
                The most satisfying thing I do is deliver solutions to complex problems
                 and design solutions that can help the organization I am also able to gather
                 the client's/company's requirements and translate them into an attractive,
                 effective and unique website. I have worked in various fields, such as
                 art education in schools, research and customer service in museums,
                 and recently as a freelance tattoo artist and illustrator.
