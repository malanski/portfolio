                &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
                I am passionate about technology and art. My purpose is to
                unite them by focusing on the fullstack development career, area in which I'm studying
                intensively, looking for challenges and projects to improve my technical
                knowledge and amplify my self-learning capacity.<br/>
                <br/>   
                &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
                I worked for 7 years as an art teacher, a position in which I developed good
                communication to exchange information and the ability to work under pressure. At
                the same time, since 2011 I have been creating illustrations and drawings in
                traditional and digital media as a freelance designer and illustrator.<br/>
                <br/>   
                &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
                Delivering solutions to complex problems and design solutions that can help 
                the enterprise I am working for is one of the most satisfying aspects of my profession, 
                as much as being able to gather the client's requirements and translate them into an 
                attractive, effective and unique website. I've worked in a variety of fields, 
                including research and customer service in museums, art education in schools, and most recently as a freelance tattoo artist and illustrator.
